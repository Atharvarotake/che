            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy is derived from resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources generate power without depleting resources or emitting harmful pollutants, making them crucial for a sustainable future. This page explores different types of renewable energy, their benefits, and how they contribute to reducing environmental impact.

            </p>            
            <h3>1. Types of Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p>Solar Energy: Uses photovoltaic cells or solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. Solar energy is one of the most accessible and abundant renewable resources.<br>
                Wind Energy: Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity. Wind farms can be located onshore or offshore, providing a versatile energy solution.<br>
                Hydropower: Uses flowing water to generate electricity. Large dams and smaller micro-hydropower systems harness the energy of moving water.<br>
                Geothermal Energy: Extracts heat from beneath the Earth's surface, which can be used directly for heating or converted into electricity.<br>
                Biomass Energy: Generated from organic materials such as plant and animal waste. Biomass is renewable and can produce biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel</p>            
            <h3>2. Benefits of Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p>Environmental Impact: Renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them environmentally friendly.<br>
                Sustainability: These resources are replenished naturally, ensuring a consistent energy supply for the future.<br>
                Economic Growth: Investment in renewable energy creates jobs, stimulates the economy, and can reduce energy costs over time.<br>
                Energy Independence: By harnessing local resources, countries can reduce their reliance on imported fossil fuels, increasing energy security</p>
            <h3>3. Challenges of Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p>intermittency: Solar and wind energy are dependent on weather conditions, which can lead to inconsistent energy production.<br>
                High Initial Costs: Setting up renewable energy infrastructure can be costly, though prices have decreased with technological advancements.<br>
                Storage and Distribution: Storing and distributing renewable energy effectively remains a challenge, as it often requires additional infrastructure.<br>
                </p>
            
            <h3>4. Future of Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p>With advancements in technology, renewable energy is becoming more accessible and affordable. Future trends include improved battery storage solutions, enhanced energy grids, and increased use of hybrid systems combining different renewable sources. Transitioning to a renewable energy-based system is key to combating climate change and building a more resilient and sustainable world.
